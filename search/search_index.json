Such systems are designed to support a potential digital forensic investigation that might concern the system in question. In other words, the systems are made with the capability to produce forensically sound evidence and handle it appropriately. The extension focuses on capturing the forensic-ready controls (i.e., implementation of requirements), revolving around potential digital evidence, including its source, storage, and mutual corroboration with others. Subsequently, the models can be analysed and reasoned about to determine whether the systems correctly address the goals of forensic readiness.</p> <p>The model represents the target system, or its part, as a process using the standard BPMN. It describes systems activities (Task), happenings (Event), exchanged data (Data Object), parts of the system and other participants (Pool), and communication between them (Message Flow). Such a simple asset-level model describes a process of regular operation of the system (IS Assets) involving the Business Assets. Then, BPMN4FRSS enhances it with forensic readiness aspects, the most important being Evidence (specialised Data Object), Evidence Source (magnifying glass symbol), and Evidence Store (specialised Data Store). Furthermore, the BPMN4FRSS allows a description of tasks and external participants relevant to forensic readiness (e.g., creating a proof of integrity for some potential evidence).</p>"},{"location":"BPMN4FRSS/model_creation/","title":"Model Creation","text":"<p>After creating the baseline, asset-level BPMN model, it can be enriched with BPMN4FRSS constructs.

Generally, the potential evidence can be divided into two categories: foreground and background evidence. The Foreground evidence utilises Data Objects that are a part of the underlining process. Such can be, in addition, marked as Potential Evidence and supplied with further details relevant to forensic readiness. The background evidence is defined just for the purpose of forensic readiness and does not have significant value to the underlining process.</p> <p>Two instances of Potential Evidence can be associated with each other by an Evidence Association, describing a relationship specified by an expression (e.g., equality of some fields) and optionally timing by direction (i.e., A precedes B).
